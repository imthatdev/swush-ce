# Swush

Swush is a secure, self-hosted full‑stack file manager and personal dashboard built with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Better Auth. It offers a unified platform to manage your bookmarks, notes, snippets, recipes, watchlist (anime, movies, TV shows), games collection, and more; all with privacy and control in mind.


## ✨ Features

### Authentication & Security
- Better Auth sessions with optional 2FA (TOTP).
- Robust session management and role-based access.
- Role-based access control with Owner, Admin, and User roles.
- Admin capabilities to promote/demote users and protect API endpoints.

### Content Management Modules
- Files, Short Links, Bookmarks*, Snippets*, Recipes*, Notes*, Upload Requests.
- Pagination, bulk selection and deletion.
- Slug support for friendly URLs.

### Sharing & Growth
- Public profiles and share pages with optional passwords.
- QR sharing with presets and avatar overlays.
- UTM builder for short links.

### Watchlist
- Track movies, TV shows, and anime via TMDB & AniList integrations. (Integrations are solely per the session, no user data is saved, but the selected data is retained.)
- Season and episode progress tracking.
- Adding personal notes.
- Bulk actions (delete, change visibility).
- Public sharing via `/l/username` with optional privacy toggle for each show.
- Import data from AniList.

### Games Collection*
- Add games manually or import from Steam.
- Track status: playing, completed, backlog, dropped.
- Bulk actions and pagination.
- Adding personal notes.
- Public sharing via `/g/username` with optional privacy toggle for each game.

### UI/UX
- Responsive design powered by Tailwind CSS v4.
- Smooth animations and transitions.
- Image paste-to-upload functionality.

### Infrastructure & Integrations
- Minimal API routes abstracted into reusable `lib/` functions.
- Email notifications for password resets, new logins, and import summaries.
- Docker support for streamlined production deployment.


## 📦 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes, TypeScript, Better Auth (authentication)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon or self-hosted)
- **ORM:** Drizzle
- **External APIs:** TMDB, AniList, Steam, RAWG
- **Email:** SMTP (configurable)


## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
bun x degit imthatdev/swush-ce
cd swush
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Setup environment variables
Copy `example.env` to `.env` and update the values:
```bash
cp example.env .env
```

### 4. Environment Variables Overview

#### Core
- Please consider checking the `.env` file for all available options. Commented variables have default values or optional.

### 5. Run database migrations
```bash
bun x drizzle-kit push
```

### 6. Start the development server
```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.


## 🐳 Deployment with Docker

### Build and run with remote database (Neon, Supabase, etc.)
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Run with self-hosted PostgreSQL
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d --build
```

- The app will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- PostgreSQL will be exposed on port `5432` (credentials configured in `.env`).

## ⏱️ Scheduled Jobs (Cron)

The job endpoints are secured by `CRON_SECRET` and must be called by a scheduler.
By default, the app runs jobs internally (single instance only) using the
`cron` npm package with the schedule set to 03:00 UTC+3 (midnight UTC). To
disable, set `ENABLE_APP_CRON=false`. Do not enable this when running multiple
app replicas or the jobs will run multiple times.

Vercel example config is in `vercel.example.json` (Vercel cron runs in UTC).
Note: Vercel cron does not send custom headers, so you will need a proxy that
adds `x-cron-secret` or relax the header check for Vercel-only deployments.

## ☁️ Cloudflare Cache Rules (HLS Only)

If you use Cloudflare Tunnels (cloudflared) and a **global “Bypass Cache”** rule,
you can still safely cache HLS streaming assets only. This improves playback
startup and reduces origin load while leaving everything else uncached.

**Recommended rule (Cache Everything only for HLS):**

**Expression**
```
(http.host eq "sub.example.domain" and starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/hls/"))
```
**Settings**
- Cache: **Cache Everything**
- Origin Cache Control: **On** (respect origin headers)
- Edge Cache TTL: **Use Cache-Control header**

This keeps:
- `.m3u8` playlists short‑lived (origin sends short cache)
- `.ts/.m4s/.aac` segments long‑lived (origin sends immutable cache)

If you want to keep your global bypass rule, just add this HLS rule **above it**
so `/hls/*` is cached while all other routes stay bypassed.


## 🍎 Apple Shortcuts (API Automation)

You can automate Swush actions from iOS/macOS Shortcuts using **Get Contents of URL**.
All requests require your API key as `x-api-key`.

### Bookmark Shortcut
**Request**
- Method: `POST`
- URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/bookmarks`
- Headers:
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `x-api-key: YOUR_KEY`
- Body (JSON):
```
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "title": "Optional title",
  "isPublic": false,
  "tags": ["reading", "ideas"]
}
```

### Short Link Shortcut
**Request**
- Method: `POST`
- URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/shorten`
- Headers:
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `x-api-key: YOUR_KEY`
- Body (JSON):
```
{
  "originalUrl": "https://example.com",
  "isPublic": true
}
```

### Note Shortcut
**Request**
- Method: `POST`
- URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/notes`
- Headers:
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `x-api-key: YOUR_KEY`
- Body (JSON):
```
{
  "title": "Optional title",
  "content": "note text",
  "sourceUrl": "https://source.com",
  "isPublic": false,
  "tags": ["ideas"]
}
```

### File Upload Shortcut
Use Shortcuts with a **Form** body and attach a file.

**Request**
- Method: `POST`
- URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/upload`
- Headers:
  - `x-api-key: YOUR_KEY`
- Body (Form):
  - `file`: (the selected file)
  - `isPublic`: `true` or `false`
  - `description`: `Optional description`
  - `folderName`: `Optional folder name`
  - `newTags`: `tag1,tag2,tag3`

## 🔧 Self‑Hosting Guide

1. **DNS & Reverse Proxy**
   - Point your domain to your server's IP.
   - Use a reverse proxy like Nginx, Traefik, or Caddy with HTTPS enabled (Let's Encrypt recommended).

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Set `APP_URL` to your domain with HTTPS.
   - Securely configure `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and database credentials.

3. **Database**
   - Choose Neon (managed) or self-hosted PostgreSQL.
   - Regularly back up your database.

4. **Email**
   - Configure SMTP settings for password resets and notifications.
