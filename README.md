# Swush

Swush is a secure, self-hosted full‑stack file manager and personal dashboard built with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Better Auth. It offers a unified platform to manage your bookmarks, notes, snippets, recipes, watchlist (anime, movies, TV shows), games collection, and more; all with privacy and control in mind.


## ✨ Features

> **Note:** The following features are [***Pro-only***](https://buymeacoffee.com/iconical/e/507392) and not available in the Community Edition (CE): **Bookmarks, Snippets, Recipes, Notes, and Games Collection**.

### Authentication & Security
- Better Auth sessions with optional 2FA (TOTP).

### UI/UX
- Responsive design powered by Tailwind CSS v4.
- Smooth animations and transitions.
- Image paste-to-upload functionality.

### Infrastructure & Integrations
- Minimal API routes abstracted into reusable `lib/` functions.
- Email notifications for password resets, new logins, and import summaries.
- Docker support for streamlined production deployment.


## 📦 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes, TypeScript, Better Auth (authentication)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon or self-hosted)
- **ORM:** Drizzle
- **External APIs:** TMDB, AniList, Steam, RAWG
- **Email:** SMTP (configurable)


## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
pnpm x degit imthatdev/swush-ce
cd swush
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

> **Note:** Swush uses [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) and Node.js. You can use `npm` or `yarn` as alternatives if you prefer, but ensure the lockfile and workspace compatibility.

### 3. Setup environment variables
Copy `example.env` to `.env` and update the values:
```bash
cp example.env .env
```

### 4. Environment Variables Overview

#### Core
- Please consider checking the `.env` file for all available options. Commented variables have default values or optional.

### 5. Run database migrations
```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

### 6. Start the development server
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.


## 🐳 Deployment with Docker

> **Note:** The Docker setup has been recently updated and optimized for smaller image size and faster builds.

### Build and run with remote database (Neon, Supabase, etc.)
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Run with self-hosted PostgreSQL
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d --build
```

- The app will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- PostgreSQL will be exposed on port `5432` (credentials configured in `.env`).

## ☁️ Cloudflare Cache Rules (HLS Only)

If you use Cloudflare Tunnels (cloudflared) and a **global “Bypass Cache”** rule,
you can still safely cache HLS streaming assets only. This improves playback
startup and reduces origin load while leaving everything else uncached.

**Recommended rule (Cache Everything only for HLS):**

**Expression**
```
(http.host eq "sub.example.domain" and starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/hls/"))
```
**Settings**
- Cache: **Cache Everything**
- Origin Cache Control: **On** (respect origin headers)
- Edge Cache TTL: **Use Cache-Control header**

This keeps:
- `.m3u8` playlists short‑lived (origin sends short cache)
- `.ts/.m4s/.aac` segments long‑lived (origin sends immutable cache)

If you want to keep your global bypass rule, just add this HLS rule **above it**
so `/hls/*` is cached while all other routes stay bypassed.

## 🔧 Self‑Hosting Guide

1. **DNS & Reverse Proxy**
   - Point your domain to your server's IP.
   - Use a reverse proxy like Nginx, Traefik, or Caddy with HTTPS enabled (Let's Encrypt recommended).

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Set `APP_URL` to your domain with HTTPS.
   - Securely configure `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and database credentials.

3. **Database**
   - Choose Neon (managed) or self-hosted PostgreSQL.
   - Regularly back up your database.

4. **Email**
   - Configure SMTP settings for password resets and notifications.
